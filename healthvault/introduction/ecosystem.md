[HealthVault](http://www.healthvault.com/) offers individuals a way to store health information from many sources in one location, so that it's always organized and available to them online. With this information at their fingertips, individuals can now take a more active role in their own health.

For physicians and healthcare enterprises

Microsoft HealthVault means easier access to a broader range of information from patients that can help health care providers give better service and more efficient, informed care.

Using HealthVault, patients can share their health history and information with healthcare providers. This serves to improve the patient/provider relationship and can also streamline the admissions and discharge processes.

Healthcare providers can also share information more easily with their patients, enabling patients to make more informed health decisions every day, and it gives providers the ability to connect beyond the organization and into the patient’s home.
